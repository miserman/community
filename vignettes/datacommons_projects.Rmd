A data commons project is a means of handing data that is distributed across multiple repositories.
This article covers components of these projects, and describes how to build and maintain them.

See the [Community Wiki](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/community/wiki/Data-Commons) for more technical detail.

The [Social Data Commons](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/social_data_commons) project is a working example, where its [build.R](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/social_data_commons/blob/main/build.R)
script lists the steps to build/update it.

# Starting a Project

The [init_datacommons](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/init_datacommons.html) function
can be used to start a data commons project.

```{r, results="hide"}
library(community)

dir <- tempdir()
init_datacommons(dir)
```

`init_datacommons` also builds a monitor site, so you can rerun it after updating a project for an
updated monitor site (like the [Social Data Commons Monitor](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/social_data_commons)).

After initialization, creating or updating a data commons project involves 3 primary steps:

1. Specify repositories, and clone/pull them in with [datacommons_refresh](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/datacommons_refresh.html).
2. Index those repositories with [datacommons_map_files](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/datacommons_map_files.html).
3. Specify a view, and run it with [datacommons_view](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/datacommons_view.html).

## Repositories

The most basic component of a data commons project is the repository list, which points to the
data repositories that make up the data commons.

You can specify these repositories through `init_datacommons`, or add them to either the
`commons.json` or `scripts/repos.txt` list.

The listed repositories are then kept in the created `repos` subdirectory, as managed by the
[datacommons_refresh](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/datacommons_refresh.html) function.

For this example, we can add a single repository:
```{r, results="hide"}
init_datacommons(dir, repos = "uva-bi-sdad/sdc.education")
datacommons_refresh(dir, verbose = FALSE)
```

## Files

The most basic requirement of a data repository is that it contain a data file in a tall format, as
initially handled by [data_reformat_sdad](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/data_reformat_sdad.html) --
these should at least have columns containing IDs (default is `geoid`) and values (default is `value`).

The [datacommons_map_files](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/datacommons_map_files.html)
function searches for files in each repository to make an index, which is used to create the views.

`datacommons_map_files` also looks for measure info files (such as those created by [data_measure_info](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/data_measure_info.html)),
which are collected and saved to `cache/measure_info.json` for use by the monitor site.

Once files are indexed, you can use the [datacommons_find_variables](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/datacommons_find_variables.html)
function to search for variables within them:
```{r}
datacommons_find_variables("2year", dir)[[1]][, c(1, 6)]
```

## Views

So far, the data commons project has collected and indexed existing repositories, but the goal of these
projects is to build unified datasets from these repositories. This is done with views.

Views are essentially lists of variables and IDs, which form a subset of the broader data commons.

Views can be specified and run with the [datacommons_view](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/datacommons_view.html)
function.

The product of a view is a set of unified data files (containing the requested variables and IDs, if found),
and a collected measures info file containing information about any of the included variables found.
These need to be directed to an `output` directory:

```{r}
output <- paste0(dir, "/view1")
datacommons_view(
  commons = dir, name = "view1", output = output,
  variables = "schools_2year_all", ids = "51059",
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

Now, we can see what was added to the output directory:

```{r}
list.files(output)
cat(readLines(paste0(output, "/manifest.json")), sep = "\n")
read.csv(paste0(output, "/dataset.csv.xz"))
```

Usually the output would be a data site project, with a build script that documents
the new datasets and rebuilds the site (such as [community_example/build.R](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/community_example/blob/main/build.R)).
Such a script can be set as the view's `run_after`, so after the datasets get rebuilt,
the site is also rebuilt.
