This document gives an outline of concepts relevant to the development of the community package.
Each section presents questions or exercises to consider.

# Data Background

## Data Alignment

1. What is the value of `value` in 2015?

```{r}
data.frame(value = c(1, 2, 3), year = c(2012, 2013, 2014))
```

2. What is the mean absolute error between the `value`s of `d1` and `d2`?

```{r}
(datasets <- list(
  d1 = data.frame(value = c(1, 2, 3), year = c(2012, 2013, 2014)),
  d2 = data.frame(value = c(1, 2, 3), year = c(2013, 2014, 2015))
))
```

MAE = `r mean(abs(datasets$d1$value[-1] - datasets$d2$value[1:2]))`

## ID Mapping

1. If ID `123` is selected, which rows should be included?

```{r}
data.frame(ID = c(1234, 1243, 1235, 1245))
```

2. Fill in all possible aggregates for `higher` from `lower`:

```{r}
(datasets <- list(
  higher = data.frame(
    ID = c(123, 124, 123, 124),
    time = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
    v1 = NA,
    v2 = NA
  ),
  lower = data.frame(
    ID = c(1234, 1243, 1235, 1245, 1234, 1243, 1235, 1245),
    time = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2),
    v1 = c(10, 5, 20, 13, 7, 15, 18, 23),
    v2 = c(1, NA, 3, NA, 5, NA, NA, NA)
  )
))
```

Aggregated `higher`:
```{r}
datasets$higher[, 3:4] <- do.call(rbind, lapply(
  split(datasets$lower[, -2], datasets$lower$time), function(d) {
    do.call(rbind, lapply(
      split(d[, -1], substring(d$ID, 1, 3)), colMeans,
      na.rm = TRUE
    ))
  }
))
datasets$higher[is.na(datasets$higher)] <- NA
datasets$higher
```

# R Packaging Background

## Documentation

Edit the description of the `dir` argument of the `site_build` function.

2. How would you get that change to appear in the local R help (`?site_build`)?

3. How would you get that change to appear on the documentation site ([site_build.html](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/reference/site_build.html))?

## Debugging

Without editing any code, calculate the row means of `cols` after it has been updated in

```r
util_make_palette(rep(c("red", "green", "blue"), each = 10), polynomial = TRUE)
```

Expected result:
```{r}
c(red = 102, green = 51, blue = 102)
```

## Testing

Write a test to cover the first uncovered line of the `datacommons_refresh` function.

1. How would you update the coverage report?

# JavaScript Background

## Editing Source

- Add a line of code that will log to the console whenever a dataset is loaded.
  1. How would you see if it works?
  2. How would you push that change out to a live site?

- There is functionality to display information about a variable when its name is clicked on.
Change that display to show a piece of information that isn't currently being shown.
  1. How would you see what information is available?

## Testing

Take a look at the coverage of the `data handler > checks > value_checks` object,
and note that some functions are not covered (such as `!=`).

Write a test to cover one of those functions.

1. How would you update the coverage report?

2. How would you trigger that function in a browser console?
